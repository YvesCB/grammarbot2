# Complete GrammarBot rewrite
A project to finally rewrite GrammarBot. Switching everything over to slash commands and changing to another db (probably will end up being surrealdb).

## Roadmap
- [ ] get basic bot running: Token, responding to a command/message
- [ ] get basic slash commands
- [ ] get db framework to work
- [ ] get bot to interact with db framework
